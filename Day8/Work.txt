Statements - 
  Sequential, 
  Selection, 
  Iteration

1) Take 10 numbers from user and find the average of all numbers that are divisible by 7

void AverageDiv()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the numbers:");
            int sum = 0;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                if (int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int n) & n % 7 == 0)
                {
                    sum += n;
                    count++;
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine($" Result is {sum/count}");
        }

2) Take a number from user and find if it is prime or not

3) Take numbers from user until the user enters a negative number. Find the number of even and off numbers in the input

Arrays


1)Take 10 numbers from user and print allthe numbers that are prime

2) take numbers 11 from user and find the one number that does not repeat itself

3) Take 5 numbers from user and store it in an array. Find if the array has the next number of an element, if yes  then count the number of such elements
Example
{23,56,78,24,57}
The answer is 2(23->24,56->57)
{2,8,6,5,10}
The answer is 1(5->6)
